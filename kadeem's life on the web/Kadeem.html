  My name is Kadeem H. Sweeney. I currently attend the University of Connecticut (UConn) in
Stamford as a Digital Media major. However as a child I would've never imagined attending such
a wonderful university or even coming to the United States. I was born in Westmoreland Jamaica
on September, 26, 1996. I lived in Jamaica with my mom, older sister, grandma, two aunts and
two younger Cousins for the first ten years of my life. Basically my mother's side of the family.
I didn't move to the states until February of the year 2008.One day I came home from school
and my mother was telling me how my father wanted me to go live with him in Stamford Connecticut.
I had no idea where that was or what she was talking about, all I knew was that I didn’t want to
leave my mom. After continuous discussions and begging me she convinced me to go live with my dad
because I had a better opportunity to succeed in the states. On the day it was time for me to leave
I remembered my mom and everyone crying and that made me further want to change my decision. After
I met up with my brother Jordan who made the same decision as me and boarded the plane things
went a little more smoothly. The flight attendants that looked after us were really nice. We
got better airplane food then everyone else and one of the flight attendants asked me to tell
everyone to fasten their seatbelts and turn off their phones. It was really cool experience
we even got to take a picture in the captain’s seat and wear his hat. Upon arrival the attendants
took us to where our dad was waiting and it wasn’t until I saw him that I realized how much I
missed him. And that’s when my sweet life began.

  While in Jamaica my favorite sport was football. Most of what I did was revolved around football
  whether it was watching, playing or talking about it. To me it was the greatest sport until I came
  to the U.S. and became involved in lacrosse. It took a while before I became a lacrosse player.
  Upon arrival to Connecticut in 2008 I was in elementary school so all I could really do was play
  sports in gym. After leaving elementary school I ended up playing baseball and doing wrestling and
  track in middle school. However doing all these sports I never felt as happy as I did playing
  soccer until my freshman year of high school. It was spring time and I was going to try out
  for baseball but one of my friends convinced me to try out for lacrosse because they need players.
  At the time I didn’t even know what lacrosse was. But I tried out and made jv and just fell in love
  with the sport. I was still relatively new to it so it took me a while to make varsity but I got
  there eventually. I literally played in rain snow hail whatever I just enjoyed the game except
  for when my team loses. To me lax was one of the greatest sports created.

As a kid I didn’t have my own computer where I could go on and learn about the word of digital media.
I didn’t even create a Facebook account until I was around 16 and a sophomore in high school. When
I created my account it was like I found the greatest website on earth because I didn’t have a
phone as yet and I was now able to connect with friends. After finding out about this and then
taking a web class in high school I became very interested in coding and creating things via
Photoshop and other adobe programs. When senior year came around in high school I had applied to
UConn Stamford and got in through the summer program. During the summer program I took DMD 1000,
an introduction class to Adobe Photoshop and Premiere. During this class I found these programs
very interesting and was determined to get more in depth and learn more about things like this
and learn more about Digital media and Design. When the fall semester started I declared my
 major as DMD and took animation lab with the same teacher I had over the summer, Professor Worwood.
 I believed he was a good teacher over the summer and i wanted to take him again. Prior to taking
 animation lab I can never say I looked forward to attending a class but while being in the class
I loved it to the point where I wanted to take it all day. After this class I figured I would
have went on the animation track in DMD. However I took a web design course the second half of
the semester and that’s where I feel as if I can succeed. I felt the same was about web design
as I did animation lab but I felt more of a connection to web design because of the coding
aspect and I understood it more. So as of right now I am a Digital Media and Design major with
a concertation in web design.
